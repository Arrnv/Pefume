# C√¥te Royale ‚Äì Animated Luxury Website (Course Project)

This website was built by following the [C√¥te Royale course by Prismic](https://coteroyalecourse.netlify.app/) ‚Äì a beautifully designed animated landing page built with Next.js, Prismic, Framer Motion, and TailwindCSS.

I followed this course to understand the real-world implementation of a high-end animated brand website. It helped me learn how to:

- Structure clean Next.js projects
- Use Prismic CMS with SliceMachine
- Add smooth page transitions and animations with Framer Motion
- Build premium UI using TailwindCSS

While this is a course project, I‚Äôve also explored customizing animations and layout for learning purposes.
